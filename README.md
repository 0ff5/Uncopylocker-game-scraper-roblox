Uncopylocker game scraper robox is a
python script that searches for uncopylocked games on the Roblox platform.
 It uses the requests library to make requests to Roblox's API and the BeautifulSoup library to parse HTML pages. 
The program prompts the user to enter a keyword to search for games and then iterates through the search results to check if each game is uncopylocked. If a game is uncopylocked, the program writes the game's URL to a file named "UnGames.txt". The program also uses the colorama library to add color to the output messages. Red is used to indicate errors, yellow for information, and green for success messages.
